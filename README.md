# break RSA in polynomial time

# An algorithm is said to be solvable in polynomial time if the number of steps required to complete the algorithm for a given input is O(n^k) for some nonnegative integer k, where n is the complexity of the input.

# Polynomial-time algorithms are said to be "fast." Most familiar mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as computing square roots, powers, and logarithms, can be performed in polynomial time. Computing the digits of most interesting mathematical constants, including pi and e, can also be done in polynomial time. 

# If RSA is broken, then two majorly depraved entities cannot move material - governments and other child predators. 

# Math consists of patterns. predictions. repetition. The greatest minds and many combinations of them have been trying to do this for a long time. I'm probably not going to be successful but I'd rather be working on this than listening to the trivial, simpleminded, degenerate conversations you people have about snacks, celebrities, and politicians.
